# SearchAndUpload

This is a script that includes a simple but effective user interface to automate a task I had at a previous job.

I made this script to remove the unnecessary process of having to do this manually and now it can be done with a few mouse clicks.

This script finds and downloads an Excel sheet from a specific Outlook email. The script then saves a backup copy of the Google BigQuery table, makes some formatting changes to the incoming data before it is uploaded and replaces the old table data.
