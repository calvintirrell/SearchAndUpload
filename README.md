# SearchAndUpload

This is a script that includes a simple but effective user interface to automate a task I had at a previous job. 

Click the file 'SearchAndUpload' to see the code itself. Please note that any information or details from my previous job were removed before being uploaded.

I made this script to remove the unnecessary process of having to do this manually and now it can be done with a few mouse clicks. Please note that I am not a programmer or developer and had no help other than Google and StockOverflow while making this script.

This script finds and downloads an Excel sheet from a specific Outlook email. The script then saves a backup copy of the Google BigQuery table, makes some formatting changes to the incoming data before it is uploaded and replaces the old table data.

Each section of code is preceded by a comment of what the following section of code does or how it relates to the program overall.

Thank you for taking a look.
